# Data Provenance Report: The Complexity Kink

## 1. Core Reproducibility (The "Bit-for-Bit" Handshake)
To ensure that any researcher can recreate the findings in this paper, the following artifacts are required and have been verified:

### A. Source Data
- **File:** `iv_enriched_dataset.jsonl` (N=35,499)
- **Provenance:** Sampled from OpenCodeInstruct (Lozhkov et al., 2024).
- **Integrity:** SHA-256 Hash of raw source data: `aa40f838d715167e6e80810d87ffc6bf1768ea4d278cfc9ba392588b447b4ed3`

### B. Analytical Environment
- **Runtime:** Python 3.10+
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - `pandas`: 2.2.3
  - `linearmodels`: 7.0
  - `statsmodels`: 0.14.6
  - `scipy`: 1.15.2
  - `joblib`: 1.4.2

### C. The Two-Stage Pipeline
The findings rely on a deterministic execution of the following scripts:
1. `train_stage1_iv.py`: Trains the complexity predictor using instruction-derived instruments.
2. `run_stage2_iv.py`: Performs the 2SLS, Hausman endogeneity test, Bootstrap Hansen threshold test, and Placebo test.

## 2. Statistical Provenance (Chain of Evidence)
The "Complexity Kink" is not a subjective observation but a statistically derived structural break. The chain of evidence is as follows:

| Evidence Step | Test Used | Result | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Instrument Strength** | First-Stage F-Statistic | **1,765.27** | Exceeds the "Rule of 10" by 176x; instruments are highly relevant. |
| **2. Endogeneity Proof** | Hausman Test | **chi2 = 108.5, p < 0.001** | Confirms that output complexity is endogenous; OLS is biased. |
| **3. Threshold Discovery** | Hansen sup-Wald Search | **gamma = 6.5** | Identifies the optimal point of structural break. |
| **4. Threshold Significance** | Bootstrap Hansen Test | **p < 0.001** | Confirms the kink is not due to random noise. |
| **5. Robustness Verification** | 500-Iter Placebo Test | **Observed Wald >> Placebo Mean** | Proves the result disappears when instruments are randomized. |

## 3. Provenance Checklist for Peer Review
Researchers can verify the "Complexity Kink" by:
1. Cloning the repository at `https://github.com/XxCotHGxX/ComplexityKink.git`.
2. Running `python src/verify_pipeline.py` to ensure the environment produces consistent results on a sample.
3. Running the full pipeline (`stage1` then `stage2`) to recreate the κ ≈ 6.5 threshold.
4. Comparing the generated `paradox_vs_kink.png` against the published figure.
